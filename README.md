## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Plotly.js** - Interactive data visualization
- **Supabase** - Backend-as-a-Service

### Backend
- **Python 3.9+** - Core backend language
- **FastAPI** - Modern, fast web framework
- **Streamlit** - Data dashboard framework
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing

### Database & Infrastructure
- **Supabase** - PostgreSQL database with real-time features
- **Render** - Cloud deployment platform

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.9+
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phiquangdat/power-sector-analytics.git
   cd power-sector-analytics
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Copy example environment files
   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```

4. **Start development servers**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- Streamlit Dashboard: http://localhost:8501

## 📊 Key Metrics

The platform tracks several critical sustainability metrics:

- **CO₂ Intensity (g/kWh)**: Carbon emitted per unit electricity generated
- **Generation Mix (MW)**: Electricity generated by source over time
- **Renewable Share (%)**: Percentage of total generation from renewables
- **Net-Zero Alignment (%)**: Annual progress vs target emissions pathway
- **Real-time Alignment Index (RAI)**: Current carbon intensity vs target
- **YTD Carbon Budget**: Cumulative emissions vs year-to-date budget
- **Decarbonization Velocity**: Rate of intensity decline vs required rate

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Independent Power Producers**: Track and report sustainability metrics
- **Industrial Heat Generation**: Monitor district heating sustainability
- **Energy Consultants**: Provide clients with comprehensive analytics
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet EU ETS, CSRD, and IRA requirements

## 📈 Business Value

- **Access to Capital**: Meet sustainability financing requirements
- **Brand Trust**: Transparent reporting builds public and regulatory trust
- **Compliance Efficiency**: Reduce manual reporting by 70%
- **Strategic Planning**: Focus on decarbonization rather than data collection

## 🔧 Development
